**scratchblocks** is used to write Scratch scripts:

- in [Scratch Forum](http://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/14772/) posts
- in [Scratch Wiki](http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Block_Plugin) articles 
- in the [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk) project guides

It's MIT licensed, so you can use it in your projects. (But do send me a link
[on Twitter](http://twitter.com/blob8108)!)

For the full guide to the syntax, see [the wiki](http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Block_Plugin/Syntax).

# Usage

## MediaWiki

Use [the MediaWiki plugin](https://github.com/tjvr/wiki-scratchblocks). This is what the [Scratch Wiki](http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Block_Plugin) uses.

It doesn't support other languages yet. Sorry about that. (But the [German
Scratch wiki](http://scratch-dach.info/) people seem to be working on this.)

## WordPress

I found [a WordPress plugin](https://github.com/tkc49/scratchblocks-for-wp). It might work for you; I haven't tried it.

## Pandoc

Code Club use their own [lesson_format](https://github.com/CodeClub/lesson_format) tool to generate the PDF versions of their project guides. It uses the [pandoc_scratchblocks](https://github.com/CodeClub/pandoc_scratchblocks) plugin they wrote to make pictures of Scratch scripts.

This would probably be a good way to write a Scratch book.

## Markdown

By using [codeclub_lesson_builder](https://github.com/arve0/codeclub_lesson_builder) you can include scratch code directly in markdown codeblocks like this:

    ```blocks
    when flag clicked
    go to x:(-50) y:(0)
    ```

The markdown builds to HTML and PDF.

## HTML

Include the scratchblocks JS file on your webpage:

```html
<script src="//scratchblocks.github.io/js/scratchblocks-3.x-min.js"></script>
```

Then just call `scratchblocks.renderMatching` after the page has loaded, which
will render matching page elements to shiny scratch blocks. Its sole argument
is the CSS-style selector for the elements that contain the scratchblocks code.
It uses `pre.blocks` by default.

```js
scratchblocks.renderMatching("pre.blocks");
```

Use `make`, or your preferred build tool, to minify the assets. You'll need to
install some dependencies first:

- Try `npm install`
- Try `brew install zopfli`, or the equivalent command for your preferred package manager.

### Inline blocks

To use blocks inside a paragraph...

```html
I'm rather fond of the <code class="b">stamp</code> block in Scratch.
```

...make a separate call to `renderMatching` using the `inline` argument.

```js
scratchblocks.renderMatching("code.b", {inline: true});
```

# Languages

[`translations.js`](https://github.com/tjvr/scratchblocks/blob/master/src/translations.js) contains all the languages needed [on the Scratch Forums](http://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/#category_head_6).

`translations-all.js` contains all the languages Scratch supports.

scratchblocks also requires some [additional words](https://github.com/tjvr/scratchblocks/blob/master/src/extra_strings.py) which aren't in Scratch itself (mainly the words used for the flag and arrow images). I'd be happy to accept pull requests for those!
